## Reordering and renaming columns
You can re-order the columns by clicking the drop-down menu at the top of the first column (labelled 'All'), and choosing `Edit columns->Re-order / remove columns â€¦`

You can then drag and drop column names to re-order the columns, or remove columns completely if they are not required.

## Sorting data
You can sort data in OpenRefine by clicking on the drop-down menu for the column you want to sort on, and choosing `Sort`.

Once you have sorted the data, the drop-down menu will expand to include a list of sub-options under `Sort`, to reverse the sort order, remove existing sorts, and/or make sorts permanent.

This latter option distinguishes OpenRefine from Excel: Here, `Sort` is temporary by default, i.e. if you remove the `Sort`, the data will go back to its original 'unsorted' state.

You can sort on multiple columns at the same time by `Sort`-ing one after another in the way described above.
