## Reordering and renaming columns
You can re-order the columns by clicking the drop-down menu at the top of the first column (labelled 'All'), and choosing `Edit columns -> Re-order / remove columns â€¦`

You can then drag and drop column names to re-order the columns, or remove columns completely if they are not required.

## Sorting data
You can sort data in OpenRefine by clicking on the drop-down menu for the column you want to sort on, and choosing `Sort`.

Once you have sorted the data, a new `Sort` drop-down menu will be displayed.
That new menu lets you amend the existing sort (e.g., reverse the sort order), remove existing sorts, and/or make sorts permanent.

Without the latter and unlike in Excel, 'Sorts' in OpenRefine are temporary - that is, if you remove them, the data will go back to its original 'unordered' state.

You can sort by multiple columns at the same time by `Sort`-ing one after another as described above. Notice how each sorted column is added to the central `Sort` dropdown menu.
